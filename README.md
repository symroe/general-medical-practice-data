# General Medical Practices

This is a mirror of the GP practice data provided by the NHS [Organisation Data
Service](http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/data/ods)

This is being used for a prototype GP practice lookup - at this time we can't
guarantee that it will be kept up to date.

The latest JSON data can be found at [https://github.com/nhsalpha/general-medical-practices/blob/master/output/general-medical-practices.json](https://github.com/nhsalpha/general-medical-practices/blob/master/output/general-medical-practices.json)
